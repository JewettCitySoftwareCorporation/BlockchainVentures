Frankly, it would be impossible to describe in a single document the entirety and subtlety of this craft. And so, at best I can only hope to define and describe the sorts of inputs and outputs you should be attempting to master.</p>

                    <p>To create a business that gives to those who believe in establishing a new type of way of doing things. We plan to execute our business on the blockchain, where it can be reviewed by anyone at any time. This project becomes a beta program for the fundamentals of business moving forward. We intended to release Blockchain Venture Coin as a net asset for every working dollar of our business. Giving to those who believe in our vision and funding ventures within a space that will forever change the way we think about business and application of technologies. Through educational content structured with new forms of media we plan to establish ourselves as a trusted authority for crypto and blockchain technologies while creating a platform to keep our community educated on the status of affairs within this space.</p>

                        <p>Through establishment of Blockchain Venture Coin we will create a model of business transparency using the blockchain. This will allow of public audit to take place at any point in time through the community or regulatory bodies alike. The business is structured to ensure that we hedge the risk of our community and private investors alike to ensure that we see premium returns through our private investment portfolios.

All founding members of this business will be written on under accountability of general partnership – while leaving an ability to write in private investors as limited partners for future ventures. Business licenses are to be filed with federal, state and local governments. All established members in partnership will be bound to the agreement that governs the business. This is a nonnegotiable clause.

Collaboration between partners happens in a space that is most conducive to the means of business in which they look to conduct. As the business budget allows we will establish acquisition of real estate assets only as they add value to the direction of the business. For now this allows us to keep start-up costs low and having working capital to push directional ventures within the company's roadmap.
